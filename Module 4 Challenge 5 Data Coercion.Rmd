#**Store the following numbers as a 5 x 3 matrix: 3, 0, 1 ,23, 1, 2, 33, 1, 1, 42, 0, 1, 41, 0, 2. Be sure to fill the matrix ROWWISE.**
#** Then, do the following:**
#**     Coerce the matrix to a data frame.**
#**     As a data frame, coerce the second column to be logical-valued**
#**     As a data frame, coerce the third column to be factor-valued**

#**Notes on Data Frames**

#>Example of DF production
#df <- data.frame(firstName = c("Nitin", "Silvy", "Ingrid", "Claire"), program = c("iSchool", "Anthro", "Anthro", "EEB"), sex = c("M", "F", "F", "F"), yearInProgram = c(1, 2, 2, 3))

##   firstName program sex yearInProgram
## 1     Nitin iSchool   M             1
## 2     Silvy  Anthro   F             2
## 3    Ingrid  Anthro   F             2
## 4    Claire     EEB   F             3

#> df[, c(1, 3, 4, 11, 12)] - use to print only select columns of the data frame

#>make sure entire file is in quotations for the df to properly run 

#>You can add rows (additional cases) or columns (additional variables) to a data frame using rbind() and cbind().

#>cbind() results in school being added as a factor while using the $ operator results in school being added as a character vector. You can see this by using the str() command.

#>You can subset a data frame by the function new_df <- df[df$school == "BU", ], for example, where you only want students under variable School=BU selected

#>You can also choose to only return particular columns when we subset via the funtion new_df <- df[df$school == "BU", c("name.last", "name.first", "school")]

#>R tends to import character string data as factors, assigning to each unique string to an integer numeric code and assigning the string as a “label” for that code. You can convert factor to character data (and vice versa) using the as.character() or as.factor() commands
