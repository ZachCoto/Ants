## Overview

>We reject a H0 if the p value obtained for a given Z or T test statistic is < α

>CIs for our sample statistic are calculated as mean ± T(1−α/2)
or Z(1−α/2) x SEM, and we can REJECT a H0 if the (1-α
) CI around does not include the expected value of the statistic

>When the sample size > 30, or when we are dealing with proportions, we use Z quantiles for calculating CIs and p values, but for sample size < 30, we use T quantiles


## One Sample T and Z test

>to evaluate whether the mean of a single set of observations is significantly different than expected under a null hypothesis 

>Suppose we have a vector describing the adult weights of vervet monkeys trapped in South Africa during the 2016 trapping season. We have the sense they are heavier than vervets we trapped in previous years, which averaged 4.9 kilograms. The mean is 5.324 kilograms. Is the mean significantly greater than our expectation?

# Our test statistic is a Z stat: it is effectively the standard normalized position of our sample mean in a distribution centered around the expected population mean.In this case, z is a quantile… the estimated number of standard errors of the mean away from the population mean that our sample falls.If we then want to see if z is significant, we need to calculate the probability of seeing a deviation from the mean as high or higher than this by chance. To do this, we can use the pnorm() function. Because we have converted our sample mean to the standard normal scale, the mean= and sd= arguments of pnorm() are the defaults of 0 and 1, respectively.

z <- (m - mu)/sem
# [1] 3.103753

p <- 1 - pnorm(z) 
# [1] 0.0009554144 #

p <- pnorm(z, lower.tail = FALSE)
# [1] 0.0009554144

#However, as noted above, our sample size from a population is typically limited. So, instead of using the normal distribution to determine the p value of our statistic, we should use the t distribution, which, as we’ve seen, has slightly fatter tails. The statistic and process is exactly the same, though, as for the normal distribution.

p <- 1 - pt(z, df = n - 1)
# [1] 0.001570945

p <- pt(z, df = n - 1, lower.tail = FALSE)
# [1] 0.001570945

#R has built into it a single function, t.test()
t <- t.test(x = x, mu = mu, alternative = "greater")

>Adult lowland woolly monkeys are reported to have an average body weight of 7.2 kilograms. You are working with an isolated population of woolly monkeys from the Colombian Andes that you think may be a different species from the lowland form, and you collect a sample of 15 weights of from adult individuals at that site. From your sample, you calculate a mean of 6.43 kilograms and a standard deviation of 0.98 kilograms. Perform a hypothesis test to test whether body weights in your population are different from the reported average for lowland woolly monkeys by setting up a “two-tailed” hypothesis, carrying out the analysis, and interpreting the p value (assume the significance level is α=0.05). Your sample is < 30, so you should use the t distribution and do a t test. Do your calculations both by hand and using the t.test() function and confirm that they match.

##Comparing Sample Means (2 Sample Tests)

>Sometimes we want to compare two groups of measurements to one another, which boils down to a hypothesis test for the difference between two means, μ1 and μ2. The null hypothesis is that the difference between the means is zero. Need to consider: if samples are paired (e.g., the same individuals before and after some treatment) or UNPAIRED/ INDEPENDENT (e.g., weights for different samples of black-and-white colobus monkeys collected in the rainy versus dry seasons) and if the variances are equal.

## Testing for Variance Equality

>A crude test for equality of variances is to divide the larger by the smaller and if the result is < 2, you can go ahead and used the pooled variance version of the test (which has many fewer degrees of freedom). In our case, we cannot, since the ratio of variances exceeds 2…

>var(x)/var(y) 
>[1] 2.746196

>We can use the var.test() function to conduct an actual statistical test on the ratio of variances, which compares the ratio test statistic we just calculated to an F distribution. The F distribution is often used to model ratios of random variables and thus is useful in regression applications and, as here, for testing whether variances from two samples are different. It is dependent upon the specification of a pair of degrees of freedom values supplied as the arguments df1= and df2= (or inferred from the number of observations in each sample).

## Comparing Paired Samples

>the null hypothesis is that the mean of individual paired differences between the two samples (e.g., before and after) is zero.

>T statistic = (d-mu)/sqrt(std^2 / n)
>d = mean of differences between sample pairs
>mu = expected mean of differences

## Testing Sample proportions with a 1 sample Z test

>the sampling distribution for another kind of sample statistic, the number of “successes” x out of a series of k trials is also roughly normally distributed. If the true population proportion of “successes” is π, then the sampling distribution for the proportion of successes in a sample of size n is expected to be roughly normally distributed with mean = pi and standard error = sqrt(pi(1−pi)/n).

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# create a population of 500 ones and 500 zeros, so pi = 0.5
pop <- c(rep(0, 500), rep(1, 500))

#take 1000 random sample means of samples n=10, calculate the proportion of ones
pi <- 0.5
x <- NULL

#This normal approximation is true as long as n is fairly large and pi is not close to 0 or 1. One rule of thumb is to check that both n × pi and n(1−pi) are greater than 5.

# we can construct Z statistics for proportions like we constructed Z and T statistics for means and test those proportions for differences from an expected value or for differences between two sample proportions.

#ex A neotropical ornithologist working in the western Amazon deploys 30 mist nets in a 100 ha grid. She monitors the nets on one morning and records whether or not a she captures any birds in the net (i.e., a “success” or “failure” for every net during a netting session). The following vector summarizes her netting results. Her netting success over the previous three seasons suggests that she should catch birds in 80% of her nets. This season, she feels, her success rate is lower than in previous years. Does her trapping data support this hypothesis?
