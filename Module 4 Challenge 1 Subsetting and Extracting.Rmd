#Because I wanted every 3 and not including the first unit, I start with 0.


> #Summary for Subsetting Vectors by [index notation] followed by extraction 

> #1: create the vector via function v1<- c("sentence" or starting number:ending number, etc)

> #2: If there is puntuation to remove, use function gsub("[[:punct:]]","",v1)

> #3: Determine exact indext notation of each unit via function str_split("v1", "bound shown for unit", "number of subunits per unit to be shown", "FALSE for Vecotor or TRUE for matrix")

> #4: To extract specific units from the vector, use function v1[seq(from = "minimum index notation", to = "max index notation", by = "every nth unit to be extracted")]
